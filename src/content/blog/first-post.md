# My First Blog Post

This is the first post of my new blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What I've learned

Astro makes it easy to create content-driven websites. Here's how I set up my blog:

1. Created a content collection for blog posts
2. Defined a schema for blog posts using Zod
3. Created Vue components for displaying blog posts
4. Set up pages for the blog index and individual posts

## Next steps

I plan to add more features to my blog, such as:

- Categories for posts
- A search function
- Related posts
- Comments section
- - Categories for posts
